Pre-Processing Pipeline Creation\n","\n","The order of pre-processing techniques in a pipeline is crucial, and we carefully followed a specific sequence. Initially, we applied lowercasing as the first step since it doesn't interfere with other techniques. Subsequently, we performed URL and HTML tag removal to ensure proper handling of these elements, followed by contraction to transform abbreviations. If we had applied these steps after punctuation removal, there was a risk of missing URLs, HTML tags, and abbreviations due to the deletion of important punctuation marks. To avoid this, we proceeded with punctuation removal, stopword removal, and big word removal, maintaining this order. The remaining steps in our pipeline involve spell checking and lemmatization. Since lemmatization can create non-existent words, it is essential to perform spell checking before lemmatization. Therefore, we apply spell checking first and conclude with lemmatization. Unfortunately, we omitted Named Entity Recognition (NER) in our pipeline due to its computational demands.

Train-Validation Split\n","\n","The train-validation split is important because it serves several purposes. Firstly, it allows us to evaluate the performance of a trained model on unseen data, which helps us understand how well the model generalizes. Secondly, it enables us to tune the hyperparameters of the model effectively by comparing performance on the validation set. Thirdly, it helps us detect and prevent overfitting, where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Finally, the train-validation split helps us avoid data leakage, ensuring unbiased performance estimation on unseen data. We are going to apply a stratified train-validation split as we have a very unbalanced dataset. Later we will address this issue by training the models giving more weight to the minority class, so we guarantee our model generalizes the best possible."],"metadata":{"id":"gl8SCn5xf-ZA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 4.1.
