Merging both Datasets (Train and Validation)\n","\n","Before moving on to the TF-IDF itself, we decided to merge both our **training** and **validation** datasets to train our model.  <br>\n","This decision offers several advantages:\n","\n","- **Vocabulary Consistency:** Since TF-IDF involves creating a vocabulary based on the entire dataset. By performing feature engineering separately on the training and validation datasets, we have the possibility of having different vocabularies for each dataset. So, merging the mentioned datasets ensures us that the vocabulary is consistent across the entire dataset, which leads to more meaningful and consistent feature representations.\n","\n","- **N-grams Coverage:** N-grams are sequences of words or characters that provide context and capture important patterns in text data. When using N-grams in TF-IDF, it is essential to have a comprehensive coverage of N-grams in the dataset.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with 1 N-Gram\n","\n","**TF-IDF** is a very common numerical representation technique used in text mining and natural language processing. It measures the level of importance of each term within a certain aggregation of documents. Each term in a document is assigned a weight that reflects its significance value. The weight is calculated based on two factors: term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).\n","\n","- **Term Frequency (TF):** Quantifies how frequently a term appears in a document (number of times a term appears in a document by the total number of terms in that document). Higher weights of a specific term, means more frequency within the respective document.\n","\n","- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Measures the rarity or uniqueness of a term across the entire document collection (logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents containing the term). Higher weight of a specific term, means that the term is less common across the document collection.\n","\n","The score for a term in a document is obtained by multiplying its **TF** by its **IDF**. This results in a numerical representation that emphasizes terms that are both frequent within a document and relatively rare across the entire collection.\n","\n","**Additional Insights on Shape and Values:** <br>\n","- Rows of the TF-IDF matrix indicate the number of documents;\n","- Columns of the TF-IDF matrix indicate the number of unique terms (columns) in the corpus;\n","- The TF-IDF matrices store the TF-IDF values for each document-term pair;\n","- Each non-zero entry represents the TF-IDF weight of a specific term in a specific document.\n","\n","**Additional Insights on Sparsity:** <br>\n","- TF-IDF matrices are often sparse because most documents contain only a subset of the total vocabulary;\n","- This means that, as expected, most entries in the matrix are zero, and only non-zero entries represent the TF-IDF values.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","In our approach, we tried a **TF-IDF with 2 N-Grams** approach, which is a variant of the TF-IDF technique that includes not only individual terms but also pairs of consecutive words (2-grams) as features. It calculates the importance of these **2 n-grams** within a document based on their frequency and rarity.\n","\n","By considering 2-grams, the TF-IDF approach captures not only single words but also the pair word combinations, providing a more complex representation of the text. This can be very useful in capturing phrases, expressions, or contextual information that carry key meaning to the understanding of the text.\n","\n","Nevertheless, this approach would be unfeasible for modelling and delivery purposes due to the size of the feature engineered datasets.\n","\n","Therefore, we procedded with a **TF-IDF with 1 N-Grams** approach, which is a variant of the TF-IDF technique that includes all the individual terms (1-grams) as features. It calculates the importance of these **1 n-grams** within a document based on their frequency and rarity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nCXmV6bGqZ0i"},"source":["### 2.1.1 Creating an instance"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TKxExVhNqZ0i"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Firstly, we created an instance of \"TfidfVectorizer\" for \"description_host_about\"\n","# column, called \"vectorizer_wordgram\".\n","# As specified in the parameters, we used 1 ngrams, whose benefits were\n","# previously described.\n","vectorizer_wordgram = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 1))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1pabLOLcqZ0j"},"source":["### 2.1.2 Training the merged dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EA4i4mvXqZ0j"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Secondly, we fitted the respective vectorizer on the recently created\n","# text data column \"description_host_about\" using the \"fit()\" method.\n","_wordgram_fitted = vectorizer_wordgram.fit(df_splitted_merged['description_host_about'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LLioXSkBqZ0j"},"source":["### 2.1.3 Transforming each splitted dataset (train, validation and test)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"JvIr5iXkqZ0k"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Thirdly, we transformed the vectorizers called \"_wordgram_fitted\" using the\n","# \"transform()\" method.

GloVe Embedding\n","\n","GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a popular word embedding technique that represents words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. GloVe is designed to capture the semantica relationships between words based on their co-occurence statistics in a given corpus.\n","\n","It starts by creating a co-occurence matrix to measure how often words appear together in a corpus. From this matrix, a probability distribtuion is derived. Word vectors are initialized randomly and then trained using an iterative process to minimize a loss function that captures the mismatch between the dot product of word vectors and the logarithm of co-occurence probabilities. The trained word vectors form a dense representation of words in a vector space, capturing semantica relationships. GloVe's advantage liers in its ability to incorporate both local and global co-occurerence statistics. These word embeddings are useful in various natural language processing tasks.\n","\n","Our approach to embedding involves individually embedding each word and then summing the embeddings of words within the same sentence. Additionally, we sum the embeddings of sentences that correspond to the same index, specifically for \"comments\". We adopted this strategy to optimize memory usage since a separate embedding for each word would require a significant amount of space. However, it's important to note that this approach may lead to decreased efficiency in the model.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hae69PPxSGTA","outputId":"26bd5fda-47c4-4d08-f8d2-8803363e4058"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":[".vector_cache/glove.6B.zip: 862MB [02:43, 5.28MB/s]                           \n","100%|█████████▉| 399999/400000 [00:26<00:00, 15367.91it/s]\n"]}],"source":["# Initiating the GloVe model with the vocab functiom from the torchtext library.\n","glove = vocab.GloVe(name=\"6B\", dim=100)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Y7wVM2SMkO9h"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Function that given a dataframe and a column will first sum the embeddings of the words\n","# of a given sentence so that we have a unique embedding per sentence.

DistilUSE - Pre-Trained Sentence Embedding Model\n","\n","The DistilUSE model is a pre-trained sentence embedding model that captures the semantic meaning of sentences. It uses a transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network known for its effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. The model is a distilled version of a larger model, designed to be more compact while maintaining performance. It provides universal sentence embeddings, meaning it can handle multiple languages and retain case information. The \"distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2\" variant indicates that it is a base model for multilingual tasks, maintaining case sensitivity. By using this model, we were able to obtain fixed-length vector representations (embeddings) for sentences, enabling tasks such as text classification, clustering, and semantic similarity calculations across languages.\n","\n","In DistilBERT the sentence embeddings are typically derived from the second-to-last transformer layer. The input sentence is processed through multiple transformer layers, and the outputs of the second-tp-last layer are averaged to obtain a fixed-length sentence embedding.\n","\n","To optimize memory usage, we employed a specific approach for embedding. When multiple sentences were present in the same textual field and index (specifically, the \"comments\" field), we chose to sum the individual embeddings. This decision was made to mitigate the storage requirements that would have resulted from using separate embeddings for each sentence in the \"comments\" field. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this approach may result in reduced model efficiency. Additionally, for textual fields exceeding 512 tokens, we further segmented and embedded them separately. We subsequently summed the embeddings to reconstruct the original sentence. This way we don't have loss of information as this pre-trained model only embedded up to 512 tokens for each sentence."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"SwpHH7yNZcBb"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Creating a function that given a DataFrame and a column name will check the\n","# textual fields that have more than 512 tokens and separate these sentences into\n","# different rows (always keeping track of the index, so later we can join them).\n","def sentence_reducer(df_input, column_name):\n","\n","    # Creating a new DataFrame with just the index and the column name we selected.\n","    df_input_step1 = df_input[[\"index\", column_name]]\n","    # Initializing our tokenizer, to check how many tokens each one of the sentences have.\n","    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\n","\n","    # Initiating a placeholder for the tokens count.\n","    tokens_placeholder = []\n","\n","    # Counting the number of tokens in each sentence.\n","    for string in list(df_input_step1[column_name]):\n","\n","        tokens1 = len(tokenizer.tokenize(str(string)))\n","        tokens_placeholder.append(tokens1)\n","\n","    # Adding a column with the count of tokens to each row of the previous initiated\n","    # dataframe.\n","    df_input_step1[\"number_of_tokens\"] = tokens_placeholder\n","\n","    # Creating a new DataFrame to store the updated rows.\n","    updated_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=df_input_step1.columns)\n","\n","    # Iterating over the rows of the original DataFrame inputed.\n","    for index, row in df_input_step1.iterrows():\n","\n","        # Creating a if condition for the rows that have more than 501 tokens.\n","        if row[\"number_of_tokens\"] >= 501:\n","\n","            # Split the textual field we are treating into chunks of 500 tokens.\n","            description = row[column_name]\n","            tokens2 = tokenizer.tokenize(str(description))\n","            chunks = [tokens2[i:i+500] for i in range(0,len(tokens2), 500)]\n","\n","            # Updating the original sentence and adding new rows with the continuation\n","            # of the sentence.\n","            for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n","\n","                # The first block of 500 tokens is converted back to string and kept in the\n","                # initial position of the original dataframe.\n","                if i == 0:\n","                    df_input_step1.at[index, column_name] = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(chunk)\n","                    df_input_step1.at[index, \"number_of_tokens\"] = len(chunk)\n","\n","                # The following blocks of 500 tokens are also converted back to strings and added\n","                # to the dataframe we initiated before.
